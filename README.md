# Maya Animation Tools
## introduction:
this is a collection of tools I developed to help with the animation process in maya, including some rigging tools, a gosting tool, and a maya to urneal engine tool.

## Install
* download and unzip the plugin 

* drag the install.mel to maya's viewport.
## Update:
Now support Maya 2025 and simple drag drop installation

## TODO:
when importing to unreal, looks like the objects we import can have any order, so importTask.GetObjects()[0] may not be the skeletal mesh

## Unreal Remote_Excution.py:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.5\Engine\Plugins\Experimental\PythonScriptPlugin\Content\Python
